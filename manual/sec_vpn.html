    <td class=content>
      SMS provides a secure communication channel for users. However, between the users and the SMS server, there are four components that users should take
      great care to hide their trace from their trackers. They are secure connection, secure web browser, secure device, and secure email account. This
      section is about how to make a secure connection from your device to the SMS server.<br>
      <br>
      As you may have already known that all the communication between the users and the SMS server is via SSL (i.e. https protocol), a quite secure way
      to use strong encryption method to protect your sent messages content, which avoid anyone to intercept your secret. Then why we still need an additional
      secure connection? The reason is that your counter parts are not script kiddies, but a gang of state supported and well equipped professional hackers.
      Even your ISP will help them to monitor your cyber activities if they request for it. So, they may not get your messages content easily, but they can
      certainly get your SMS sites DNS names and IP address easily if you don't take further steps to hide them. Once they know your SMS sites, they
      can track all connected IP addresses to these sites. If SMS users don't connect to the SMS server with secure connections, their true identities can be
      uncovered by government agents. Therefore, secure connection serves two purposes, hide your SMS sites and true identity of SMS users, or at least protect
      SMS users even your enemies know your SMS sites.<br> 
      <br>
      There are three ways to build a secure connection. They are virtual private network (VPN), Tor browser (Tor network), and public available WiFi
      connections. In general, public available WiFi hotspots are considered insecure, then why should they be used? Because 'secure' in here also means
      anonymity.<br>
      <br>
      <b><u>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</u></b><br>
      VPN could hide your true IP address as you connect to your SMS server, but you must remember that VPN is <b>NOT</b> designed for anonymity. Your VPN
      provider knows your true IP address (and hence your true identity), and all your cyber activities if he wants to monitor you. Therefore, how to choose
      your VPN provider is very important for your safety. The basic principles are:<br>
      <br>

        <td class=content>
          If you need to hide yourself from your local government, don't subscribe those VPN providers that your local government's jurisdiction can be 
          applied to them.

          If it is possible, use free VPN services. Although freely available VPN services have many disadvantages, they could provide one more layer of
          anonymity for you. They don't have your payment record, and payment record can be used to identify a person. However, you should remember, free
          VPN providers still know your true IP address, and your cyber activities. So, rule number 1 must be considered as select your free VPN provider(s).

      For free VPN service, I recommend <a href="https://www.vpngate.net">VPN Gate</a>. It is developed by University of Tsukuba, Japan. Please note that
      all VPN servers provided by VPN Gate come from volunteers, and some of them are located into the territory of dictatorial regime like China and Russia,
      you should avoid those VPN servers. Table 5.1.1 shows you the brief steps to install and use VPN Gate service on varied platforms. <br>

          on it will let another pop-up window appear for you to select connection protocol (TCP or UDP), then click the 'OK' button to build a VPN link for
          your computer. If everything is OK, a new item 'VPN Gate Connection' with status 'Connected' will be shown on the SoftEther VPN Client Manager.

          Connect, not VPN Gate List), and it is on disconnected status. Click on the OpenVPN profile, it will try to build a VPN connection between your
          Android device and the VPN server. If the VPN connection is built successfully, the button in front of the OpenVPN profile will be turned on and
          changed to green colour, and status becomes 'CONNECTED'. To disconnect a VPN connection, click on the OpenVPN profile again.

      <b><u>Tor Browser (Tor Network)</u></b><br>
      Tor browser is designed for user anonymity. When you use Tor browser to go to the internet, it will go through three arbitrary selected nodes of Tor network
      around the world, and connection between all nodes are strongly encrypted. Because of it's nature, speed of Tor browser could be very slow. Tor project officially
      support five platofrms. They are MS Windows, MacOS X, Linux, OpenBSD and Android. Tor browser installation on MS Windows and Linux are quite straightforward, just
      decompress the download archive and run it. Table 5.1.2 summarize some tips for Tor Browser installation and usage you should know about.<br>

          The officially supported Tor browser for Android needs Orbot (proxy with Tor) to run. i.e. You need to install two apps: Orbot and Tor browser for Android.
          Tor browser for Android is still in alpha state (as at year 2019), that means it may still have bugs or features missing.

          Although Tor project has no officially supported Tor browser on iOS (iPhone and iPad), an application called 'Onion Browser' (developed by Mike Tigas) can
          use Tor network to protect your web surfing activities. However, you must bear in mind that Onion Browser can't fully protect your IP address from leaking
          outside Tor network, especially on multimedia handling.

      Besides web surfing, if you want to use Tor network to protect all your internet activities, you may turn to use Whonix. Whonix is two VirtualBox virtual
      machines built on Debian Linux. One is called 'gateway', another one is called 'workstation'. 'Gateway' has two network interfaces, one of the network
      interfaces is used to connect to the Tor network, another network interface is used locally for 'workstation'. All internet connection from the 'workstation'
      must go through the 'gateway'. Therefore, all internet activities on the 'workstation' is protected by the Tor network. Since Whonix must be run on VirtualBox, so
      that it is for desktop or laptop computers only, and it supports MS Windows, Linux, MacOS X and Qubes.<br>
      <br>
      To download Whonix, go to it's <a href="https://www.whonix.org/download/">download page</a>. For more details of Whonix, you may consult

      <b><u>Public WiFi Hotspot</u></b><br>
      Public available WiFi hotspots are usually insecure places (see <a href="https://thevpn.guru/public-wifi-hotspot-threat-privacy">this article</a> for details).
      However, if you take all the precautions, you could still keep yourself anonymity and safety.<br>
      <br>
      Although public WiFi hotspot can't expose your true identity directly, your trackers still have many ways to correlate indirect data to identify you.
      For example, coffee cafes usually provide public WiFi access, and those places also commonly have CCTV monitoring. Your face on CCTV timeline, and internet
      activities log on the public WiFi router, could let secret police narrow down who is the right person they target. Therefore, the following tips are for you as
      using public WiFi hotspots: <br>
