      There are so many web browsers out there on available platforms, especially on mobile devices, but I here only discuss about one web browser and it's variant:
      Firefox and Tor browser. Why them? Because they provide an essential feature that all other web browsers don't have. Firefox can remove all traceable data of
      your surfing history automatically as you quit the browser (except on iOS). So yes, I recommend Firefox only. Now, let's show you how to configure Firefox for
      Android to achieve this goal.<br>
      <br>
      Launch Firefox for Android, bring up the system menu by clicking the vertical three dots icon on right top corner. In the menu, select 'Settings', then select
      'Privacy'. On 'Privacy' page, check the check-box of 'Clear private data on exit' like figure 5.2.1 shown.

    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

    <td class=content>
      Then decide which data you want to delete as browser exits. Return to the 'Settings' page, select 'Clear private data', then a pop-up window will appear like
      figure 5.2.2, you should check ALL items on it.

    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

  <tr>
    <td class=content>
      Finally, when will Firefox start to clear private data? It is done as you click on the 'Quit' item on the menu as figure 5.2.3 shown.

      Configure Tor browser for Android to clear traceable data is similar to Firefox for Android, the only difference between them is that Tor browser for Android
      must connect to Tor network first, then it lets you access the configuration settings for private data removal.<br>
      <br>
      Configure desktop version of Firefox for private data removal is quite easy, select 'Preferences' from Firefox system menu, then select group 'Privacy & Security'
      from the left hand side menu. On 'History' section, let Firefox 'Use custom settings for history', and check the check-box 'Clear history when Firefox closes'.
      Then click on the button 'Settings' besides it to bring up private data removal options selection pop-up window, you should select ALL available items on it, and
      click the 'OK' button to confirm. Similarly, Firefox will clear all your surfing history and data as you quit it.<br>
      <br>
      For Firefox on iOS (i.e. iPhone and iPad), it doesn't implement this feature, actually no any web browser on iOS has similar function. Therefore, iPhone and iPad
      are not the secure enough platforms to use SMS.<br>
      <br>
      Other than the private data removal feature, two Firefox add-ons should be installed also to further harden your browser's security. They are 'NoScript' and 'HTTPS
      Everywhere'.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, if you use Firefox to access SMS messaging site, then you should limit to use this web browser to access the other web sites. Especially those web sites
      could expose your true identity, such as Amazon, Facebook, Reddit,..., etc. And don't use it to access those risky web sites such as pirated software downloading,
      illegal gaming materials exchange or adult sexual video streaming. Those web sites often plant malware or adware on your web browser or even your device, which
      may leak your true IP address outside your secure connection. Simply to say, let your SMS accessing web browser and device as clean as possible.
